Once there was a little girl named Clarissa, she was ten-years-old and she lived in a mental hospital, because she killed her mom and dad. She got so bad she went to kill all the staff in the hospital so the more-government decided that best idea was to get rid of her do they set up a special room to kill her, as humane as possible but it went wrong the machine went wrong. And she sat in agony for hours until she died. Now every week on the day of her death she returns to the person that reads this letter. On a Monday night at 12:00a.m. She creeps into your room and kills you slowly, by cutting you and watching you bleed to death. Now send this to ten other pictures on this one site, and she will haunt someone else who doesn't. This isn't fake. Apparently ,if you copy and paste this to ten comments in the next ten minutes u will have the best day of your life tomorrow. U will either get kissed or asked out, if you break this chain u will see a little dead girl in your room to night. In 53 minutes someone will say I love you or I am sorry\n",

But regardless he came here for humanity and not just for India so u can't really claim him as yours, beside. India is only a very small percent buddhist anyways and that's a fact so there's no point of even claiming that Buddhism belongs to India. The country has taken on the wheel of buddhism on their flag but yet they don't predominantly carry on his faith, which in my opinion is almost contradicting but either way. I am khmer and I know that the khmer culture was in fact influenced by Indian/hindu culture.  It all start with the Indian King (Hun Tien) who clashed with the Chinese princess (lieu Ye) made war on ancient land that is now khmer land,then fell in love.
